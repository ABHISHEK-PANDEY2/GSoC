# Project Abstract
TensorMap is a web application that will allow the users to create machine learning algorithms visually. TensorMap supports reverse engineering of the visual layout to a Tensorflow implementation in preferred languages. 
The goal of the project is to let the beginners play with machine learning algorithms in Tensorflow without less background knowledge about the library. 
The main goal of this year's contribution was to make the TensorMap application bug free with clearly documented steps for setup. Also I added some new features to the existing app to make it more user friendly
