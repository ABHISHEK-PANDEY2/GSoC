### Project Abstract

CLocal GCP is an local emulator to test or mock the Google Cloud Services without deploying into Google Cloud Platform, and provide easiness for developer by reducing the cost. Our goal is to have all GCP services possible local services into one single project and provide easiness to run a whole Google Cloud project locally. Currently project supports Cloud functions and Cloud storage to run locally.
