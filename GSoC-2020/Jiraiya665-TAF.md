### Project Abstract
TAF is a new Cloud-based Universal Test Automation Framework that mainly focuses on regression testing. So it will greatly improve the quality and performance of the software. TAF will also build on testing methodology independence. This is going to be a huge advantage because TAF will be a Universal framework that supports both agile and waterfall testing methodologies. Itâ€™s going to be a very user-friendly Cloud-based Universal Test Automation framework with lots of new features and functionalities.
