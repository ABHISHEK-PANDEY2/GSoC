### Project Abstract

**`NodeCloud ‚òÅÔ∏è`** is standard library to get a single API on the open cloud with multiple providers. It is a NodeJs library which comes with plugins for each cloud provider. NodeCloud's aim is to abstract away the differences between different cloud providers. It provides an easy to use API for developers in order to interact with different cloud providers.

### Work Summary

 NodeCloud is an open-source project under SCoRe Lab. Initially, I was aimed to enhance Node cloud by manually implementing new services in AWS, Google Cloud and Azure plugins. But after an awesome suggestion of my mentor Rajika Imal it was decided to automatically generate the NodeCloud plugins classes through code generation. so as to achieve it TypeScript‚Äôs compiler API was used to parse SDK files to extract required data, and well as to transform source code to generate the Node Cloud plugin classes. The required parsers, transformers and other functionalities for this automated process is developed for the AWS, GCP and Azure plugins. Furthermore, the core module and the AWS, GCP and Azure plugins are now located in the same repository(mono repo) managed with Lerna. The API documentation of these plugins is automatically generated with the help of JSDoc and TypeScript‚Äôs compiler API.

### What Covered

 * Implemented parsers, transformers and generators in the code generation component for AWS, GCP and Azure. 
 * Structuring the project as a monorepo with Yarn and Lerna.
 * Created dummy data for unit testing and Wrote unit tests for the code generation component.
 * Automating the API documentation process with JSDoc and Typescript compiler API.
 * Updating the documentation of the NodeCloud project.
 * Finalizing the `node-cloud.yml` file.
 * Generating the JavaScript classes for NodeCloud plugins and updating the plugins with them.
