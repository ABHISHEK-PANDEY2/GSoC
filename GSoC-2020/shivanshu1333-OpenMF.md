### Work Summary
OpenMF is an open-source forensic tool for Android smartphones that helps digital forensicinvestigators throughout the life cycle of digital forensic investigation. Initially OpenMF was avaiable as a command line tool only, the main target for GSoC'20 was to create a web client for OpenMF. The work targeted during this period was to add support for web client for this command-line tool with additional features like Admin, Management and Extractor roles. These roles have different privileges to the tool and as a whole, it becomes a complete open-source forensic tool for Android smartphones which then can be used by any organization.
The following flow chart shows the work covered during GSoC'20:

**<p align="center">Work completed during GSoC'20</p>**

### What Covered
Modify the current code base to make a strong robust command-line tool for OpenMF.<br />
Design logo and other frontend designs and components.<br />
Design and Implement a Client-side Framework for Web Client.<br />
Design and Implement Login, Admin, Management, and Extractor pages.<br />
Implementation of backend from scratch and writing different APIs in the flask framework.<br />
Extending the functionality of OpenMF to include management of files on the server.<br />
Design and implement a Database model, relation mapping (ORM) in the database to incorporate the above functionalities in MySQL using the SQLAlchemy toolkit.<br />
Write a project wiki and update the user and developer documentation.<br />
Weekly blogs on medium.<br />

### What left
Some changes in the frontend to make it more user.<br />
Design and develop a logic to implement Analysis on the cases i.e. if in Case#1 and in Case#2 we have to search for common keyword "fire", then the Analytics API should check all the dbs and find the result. More complex scenarios can be introduced.<br />
More enhanced routing of the React App to provide better user experience
