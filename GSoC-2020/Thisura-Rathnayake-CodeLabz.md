### Work Summary
The work I did on CodeLabz during GSoC is developing the front-end components of the project. The project was developed using React and Ant Design as the design language. The UI was built in atomic components for better reusability and about 90% of the UI components are mobile-friendly as well. The most challenging part was figuring out the layouts of some pages. For example, for the page that manages the organizations a user handles, I decided to implement a dashboard-like interface which is convenient to handle all the operations of an organization. This reduces the amount of searching, navigations the user has to go through which improves the user experience. For all the interactions, the application gives feedback to the user of the state of the operations in the form of either a progress indicator or a feedback message, which also improves user experience. The most interesting and challenging part for me was implementing the collaborative editor. For that Firepad was used and I added new features to that as well. On a final note, CodeLabz turned out to be a beautiful project with great UI and UX.
