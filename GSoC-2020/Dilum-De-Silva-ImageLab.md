### Project Abstract
ImageLab is a standalone tool which supports anyone to get started with image processing related concepts and techniques in an interactive, less logical way. So, this tool enables and also motivates the fresh users to understand how image processing concepts work by interacting with ImageLab. Moreover, for the users who are already comfortable with image processing tasks ImageLab offers a test environment before they move ahead with actual implementation or development.

### Work Summary
Since ImageLab was in the conceptual level when I was starting the GSoC. The very first milestones were set to design the architecture and to refine architecture.
and next with the received feedback from mentors started developing the prototype. Later it also went through a lot of refinements to reach the current state of the project. In a summary following milestones have been acheived.
- Requirement gathering and refinement with the mentors.
- Designing the architecture and refining it based on the mentor's feedback. 
- Develop the prototype and improve it based on the mentor's feedback.
- Fixing and solving issues and blockers occurred during the implementation phase with the support and 
guidance of mentors.
- Demonstrating the work and attending meetings with the mentors.
- Preparing documentation related to the project.

### What Covered
- Designed and finalized the ImageLab architecture.
- Developed the base UI of the ImageLab.
- Integration of maven build automation and dependency management for the project.
- Base architecture of the ImageLab based on MVC which consists,
    - Operators panel and functionalities.
    - Visualizing panel or the playground and functionalities.
    - Information panel and functionalities.
    - Preview panel and functionalities.
    - Properties panel and functionalities.
- Extendable architecture to add more operators.
- Validation mechanism to validate openCV operation order.
- Operator execution mechanism.
- Custom drag, drop and detect mechanism related to project requirements.
- Dashboard related functionalities (Refresh, Execute).
- OpenCV operations based operators,
    - Basic operators.
    - Geometric transformation operators.
    - Image conversion operators.
    - Image blurring operators.
- Reusable utility functionalities.
- Exporting openCV operation order as a file.
- Integration of lint issue checking to improve code quality.
- Code commenting.
- [Documentation](https://dilum1995.github.io/ImageLab/) as a jekyll website.   
    

### What left
- Introducing more openCV operations.
- Operator custom shape and animated attachable features.
- Testing related to the implementation.
- Exporting openCV operation order as an illustration.
