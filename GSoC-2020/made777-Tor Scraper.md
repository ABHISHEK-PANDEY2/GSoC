### Project Abstract
The Tor network is a volunteer-run system that helps make internet use more anonymous. Tor Scraper can crawl web pages hosted on the ToR network. At monument Tor Scraper only supports curl based and scrapy based crawlers. Splash is a lightweight, scriptable headless browser and it can extract web site structure and take live screenshots of the crawled site. Integrated splash crawler to Tor Scraper provides nice tree-based tor hidden service website structure analysis features.
