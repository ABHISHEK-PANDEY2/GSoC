### Project Abstract
Building and maintaining a website is an essential task for any business or organization. This project aims to ease the workflow of getting a website up and running by developing a “generalized website builder”, with the help of the Gatsby Js Framework. The individuals would be able to utilize this generalized platform to plug-in required modules and configure the datasource as per requirements to build custom websites for their organizations.
The built website builder will be used to to fully migrate https://www.scorelab.org/, the current Score Lab website to Gatsby Js and also migrate all the data into an easily maintainable datasource. The new website would be a highly refined version of the current site in terms of the look and feel and the maintainability.
