### Project Abstract
This project focuses on developing a crowd-sourced dictionary which will support the English language as well as multiple other languages. The dictionary will provide the users with a platform containing concise definitions along with examples on the usage of words, in multiple languages.

Community Dictionary includes words/terms from multiple languages, representing multiple categories. Each word is defined along with an example of each word's usage. These words, definitions and examples can be added in any language the user desires. The users have the facilities to search through the dictionary fast and easily. The users are able to comment on how accurate the given definitions are to ensure reliability. If any user who is not happy or disgreeing with a word or a definiton has the ability to report it to the community for review.

### Work Summary
For GSoC 2020, in the first coding phase i focused on communicating with my mentors and the fellow developer in order to build the initial plan for the community dictionary. Since the community dictionary was an idea level project, the base plan was an important step in the implenetation phase. When we moved onto the actual coding i mainly focused on user interfaces, usability and user experience. The implementation was carried out using ReactJS and Ant Design. Improving the usability and the attractiveness of an every-day dictionary proved to be hard since the begining. It was important to remeber that almost every person is familiar with a dictionary, so out main target was to bring the real-life metaphors into the actual final product. 

Apart from real-life analogies we incorporated, one of the main functionalities of the community dictionary is the ability given to the user for commenting and reporting a word (based on some rules and regulations). For the users ,who are more interested in words we added a word of the day fucntionality and trending words functionality. To imporve the usability and easiness of browsing through the dictionary, the platform includes a alphabetical index, categorical view and a search functionality.

### What Covered
* Trending words and Word of the day.
* User registration and logins.
* Alphabetical indexing and search.
