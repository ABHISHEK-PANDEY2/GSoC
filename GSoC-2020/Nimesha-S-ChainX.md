### Project Abstract
In commerce, supply chain management, the management of the flow of goods and services, involves the movement and storage of raw materials, of work-in-process inventory, and of finished goods from point of origin to point of consumption. A consumer being able to keep track of these intermediate steps at any given point ensures the superiority and the freshness of the product he/she is about to consume. S-ChainX is an open source platform, in which the organizations can define their subsequent procedures that take place in their supply chains. The agent will be inserting the corresponding details to the platform and on the other hand, the consumers will be able to view the stored information. To make sure that the consumers get accurate data and that the data can not be manipulated, S-ChainX uses blockchain to store the transactions.

### Work Summary
For GSoC 2020, I mainly focused on building the hyperledger fabric network for S-ChainX and its smart contracts. The blockchain network for the project was developed using the IBM extension and the smart contract project is extracted in a way that can be easily hosted on IBM cloud witha few clicks. For the demonstration, the network has one orderer, one peer and one org in it. The org admin has the priviledge to submit and evaluate the transactions. Furthermore a prototype mobile application was also developed using React Native to demonstrate the consumer's experience.

### What Covered
* Smart contract project for a hypothotical business scenario (Coffee)
* Hyperledger fabric network for demo purposes including 1 org, 1 orderer, 1 peer
* SC project extraction to support plug and play on IBM cloud
* Mobile app prototype for consumers

### What left
* Hosting the SC project on a blockchain hosting provider
* API to query data from the mobile application
* Generate QR codes when the "Create" smart contract is sumbited
* Interate maps and history functionality to the mobile application
