What Open Source Organisations aims is for more productivity, which can be achieved when the organisation's members promote, collaborates, co-operates with each other. And hence Ask-SCoRe application helps in achieving the motive.

Ask SCoRe app is the community app, which helps organisation in Collaboration, teamwork, promotion, cooperation with their members(Mentors, Mentees, Students). Ask SCoRe application is implemented using React-Native. This app also uses Go-Social Framework in order to create and use the components. This app aims to resolve queries by anyone in the organisation and let members communicate in the Forums/Channels.
