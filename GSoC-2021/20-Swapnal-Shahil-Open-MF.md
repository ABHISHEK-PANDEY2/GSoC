# Project Abstract

OpenMF is an open-source forensic tool for Android smartphones that helps digital forensic investigators throughout the life cycle of digital forensic investigation. OpenMF is currently able to extract data of SMS(text messages), Facebook, WhatsApp, Browser history, Bluetooth data, EXIF data from images, Location history, General information of the device, Call logs, and Contacts. Data can be extracted from CMD as well as using API(POSTMAN) or from Frontend also.
Also OpenMF is now able for showing analytics and relate data of cases using graphs, maps and Tables.

# Work Summary


OpenMF is an open-source forensic tool for Android smartphones that helps digital forensic investigators throughout the life cycle of digital forensic investigation.From Google Summer of Code 2021 OpenMF will be able to extract data of SMS(text messages), Browser history, Bluetooth data, EXIF data from images, Location history along with General information of the device, Call logs,Facebook , WhatsApp and Contacts data(already exists). Data can be extracted from CMD as well as using API(POSTMAN) or from Frontend also. APIs were created to fetch data where ever required. Also OpenMF portfolio created and hosted [OpenMF-release](https://swapnalshahil.github.io/OpenMF-release/)

                                                                                                                                                
Also OpenMF is now able for showing analytics and relate data of cases using graphs, maps and Tables which comes in Data Visualization.

* **Common Words**: Search common between the data.
* **Keyword Search**: Search keywords to relate the cases from the overall database as well as from particular case.
* **Filter Cases**: Filter cases date-wise or by tags.
* **Location**: Find the searched location from the case.
* **General Info**: Get the general information of the device.
* **Tag Association**: Give tags to cases and filter cases by tags.
* **Data Visualization**: Visualize data using maps, graphs, and tables from the case.
* **Compare Case**: Relate one case with another using graphs, maps, and tables. Common locations on map, common browser history with frequency on Graph, common call logs, text messages using tables are available on OpenMF front end.

# What Covered

* Extraction of the text messages.
* Extraction of browser history.
* Extraction of Bluetooth files.
* Extracting data (EXIF) from images(like location, date, and time)
* Extraction of location from the device.
* Keyword search - Implementation of keyword search to get all the cases that have the searched keyword.
* Implementing keyword search from cases.
* Maximum occurred common word/data between two cases.
* Returning all the common words between two cases.
* Filtering Cases by Date or range of date.
* Creating APIs for the above.
* Tag association and tag-based search like searching cases that are tagged with theft to get all the theft-related cases.
* Customized keyword search `<kw1> + <kw2> + â€¦ + <kwN>`
* Analytics based on location.
* Implementing analytics on the front end.
* Presentation of observed analytics - graph, library, an API will be developed which will send the database data to the graph generating library to create required graphs and   that will show in our OpenMF frontend.
* Presentation of observed analytics between two cases using graphs, maps, and tables.
* Create Wiki for SCoRe Lab OpenMF.
* Solved minor bugs.
* Project update by writing blogs.

# What left
  Some more analytics is possible if more research is done in project.
