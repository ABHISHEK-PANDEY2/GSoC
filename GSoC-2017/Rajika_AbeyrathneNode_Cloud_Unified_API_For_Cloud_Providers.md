### Project Abstract

NodeCloud is an easy to use abstract API which will remove the burden of switching in between many libraries to use cloud related APIs. NodeCloud is a Node.js library which will integrate Google Cloud and AWS services under one hood. Even though the scope of the project is limited to Google Cloud and AWS, according to the flexible, plug-gable architecture it will be convenient to add more cloud providers in the future of this project.

Support for following services were added,
- Compute
- Database
- Network
- Storage

Along with development of APIs, I added documentation and unit tests in every week.
Created tutorial series.
