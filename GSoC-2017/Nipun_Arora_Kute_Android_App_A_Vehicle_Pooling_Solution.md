### [Project Wiki](https://github.com/scorelab/kute/wiki)

 - Contains **Phase wise detailed work summary** 
 - Contains **Developer Guide** along with the all important user story guide which would help the upcoming open-source enthusiasts to quickly set up the working environment
 - Also Contains the detailed working theory of the **Matching Algorithm**

### [GSoC Blog](https://kutegsoc.wordpress.com/)

 - Updated the blog with **weekly updates** on the tasks assigned with proper insights given through screenshots

### Work Summary

 - Developed the feature enabling private vehicle owners as well as general public to **pool their drives  using their Android devices.**
 - Implemented **UI components** through a modular approach promoting the **"DRY"(Dont Repeat Yourself) paradigm** 
 - Created Custom Animations(FAB Animations) **enhancing UX(User Experiences)**
 - **Implemented various google APIs** such as the places and directions api along with **facebook sdk** to get user specific data(User Friends)
 - Developed backend on **Django framework to host the matching algorithm**
 - **Implemented Task queues** on backend to enhance matching workflow ,since the algorithm data collection is time consuming 
 - Implemented the **entire notification workflow** through Firebase Cloud Messaging.

### What left

 - Comparing with the project idea on Organisation's website and my proposal all goals have been achieved in addition to the notification workflow, **Still we would like to scale and add some additional features such as:** 
 

   
1. **Implementing live location tracking on OSM**(Open Source Maps),the background service for which has already been coded and added to the repository ,we just need to draw live location on map
2. On the backend, **Matching among user routes also, not just active trips**  
3. Starred Routes Functionality (UI for this feature also has been created)

### Reference

 - Added All major references along with their use cases in the Developer guide on the organisation repository's wiki.
