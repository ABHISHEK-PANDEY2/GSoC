### Work Summary
Main goal was designing a smart contract monitoring service for Ethereum utilizing that can provide enhance querying mechanisms for users.
I have completed the NodeJS + GraphQL server that can provide the querying interface.
Further, for block extraction and storing it to graph database, a separate Python script was developed.

### What Covered
- GraphQL server
- Contract querying
- Reading smart contract properties
- Authentication middleware
- Python based block extractor

### What left
- User-based notifications
- Smart contract specific notifications (for balance)
