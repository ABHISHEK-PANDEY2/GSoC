### Project Abstract
This is a project that is intended to support Public Health Inspector (PHI) to find and investigate “Dengue(mosquito) breeding sites in a given location.” Breeding of mosquitoes is becoming a severe issue in Sri Lanka and it is difficult to investigate the breeding places in urban areas mainly due to the height of the buildings. Currently PHI’s are investigating such locations by themselves where possible.
